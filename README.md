# Simon Game

This is an interactive **Simon Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **jQuery**. The game challenges players to follow an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. The objective is simple: repeat the pattern exactly as it is shown. With each correct repetition, the pattern length increases, providing a fun and engaging challenge.

### Features:
- **Level System**: The game has a progressive level system where the pattern becomes longer as you successfully repeat the sequence.
- **Sound Effects**: Each color is accompanied by a distinct sound to enhance the gameplay experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The game interface adjusts seamlessly across devices, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Simple UI**: Clean and minimalistic design for an intuitive gameplay experience.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the game.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for handling user input, sequence generation, and level progression.
- **jQuery**: Used for handling DOM manipulation and event management.

### How to Play:
1. The game will start by displaying a sequence of colors.
2. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding color buttons.
3. Each correct input adds one more color to the sequence.
4. The game ends if you fail to repeat the sequence correctly.
